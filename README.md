## About
The YubiKey Removal Behavior **sample** application is inspired by the native Windows "Smart Card Removal Behavior" feature and extends a similar level of control to FIDO2 Security Keys (YubiKeys) by locking a compatible Windows workstation when a YubiKey is removed. It does this by monitoring for YubiKey removal events and checking the value of the ```isEnabled``` registry key. If the value is set to ```1```, the code will lock the workstation.

**DISCLAIMER**: This application was created for demonstration purposes only. It is _not_ a product of Yubico and as such this application and accompanying Microsoft Administrative Templates (ADMX) are provided "as-is" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied.

## Installation
Run the provided MSI (no interaction is required) and reboot the computer for changes to take effect.

ðŸ’¡The YubiKey Removal Behavior application is supported on 64 bit Windows 10 and Windows 11. For the application to work the target system must also have been configured for [Security Key sign-in](https://swjm.blog/three-ways-of-enforcing-security-key-sign-in-on-windows-10-windows-11-4f0f27227372).

Here is an example of a running the installer from command line: 

```bash
msiexec /i /qn "YubiKey Removal Behavior Tool.msi"
```
The Microsoft Installer (MSI) will install the application in the ```C:\Program Files\Yubico\YubiKey Removal Behavior\``` directory. Additionally, it will create two registry entries: 

1.  ```isEnabled``` with a default value of ```1``` under ```HKLM\Software\Policies\Yubico\Lock workstation on YubiKey removal\```. This entry is later controlled via Group Policy (GPO).
2. Reference to the ```YubiKeyRemovalBehavior.exe```executable is added to ```HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run```. This entry makes sure that the tool is started on login.

**Note**: All registry keys are created in context of the machine in order to enforce functionality for all users.

## Usage

### Lock workstation on YubiKey removal
By default (no configuration required), the YubiKey Removal Behavior application will lock the workstation on YubiKey removal. This behavior can be turned OFF/ON using Group Policy (GPO), directly in host registry or using an MDM such as **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** / Intune (see roadmap).

#### Administrative template (ADMX)
The accompanying administrative template (ADMX) adds the option to _enable_ (default) or _disable_ YubiKey removal behavior by setting a central (or local) GPO. The template is designed to augment the existing ```credentialprovider.admx``` with an additional setting. To use this template:

1. Copy the ADMX file ```YubiKeyRemovalBehavior.admx``` to location: ```C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions``` the on your domain controller (DC) / member server
2. Copy the ADML file ```YubiKeyRemovalBehavior.adml``` to location: ```C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-US```
3. Open the GPO editor (restart if open previously) and navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative Templates** > **System** > **Logon**
4. Double-click on 'YubiKey removal behavior' and toggle policy: ```Enabled``` (ON) or ```Disabled``` (OFF)
5. Click **Apply** and **OK**.

**Note**: Since the setting applies to the computer object, computers must have read access to the GPO.


### Disable the functionality
The application can be "disabled" by changing the ```isEnabled``` registry key to ```Disabled```
 using Group Policy (GPO) or by editing the host registry directly. Note that toggling the registry setting does not deactivate or uninstall the application -it simply stops the workstation from locking on YubiKey removal, but the application still runs(!)

### Uninstall
The application can be uninstalled from **Add/Remove Programs**, using **GPO** or **MDM**.

Here is an example of uninstalling from command line: 

```bash
msiexec /qn /x "YubiKey Removal Behavior Tool.msi"
```

## Roadmap
Possible improvements includes:
- Provide script or instruction to toggle ```isEnabled``` with Microsoft Endpoint Manager
- Using variables and/or relative paths in the installer (paths, registry keys)
- Reducing overall footprint / size of of application
- Making the application launch sooner at logon (run as a service?)
- Code signing

## Contributing
Any help on the above (see roadmap) is welcome.
